## 🧩 Categories of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity can be divided into the following five categories:

1. **Critical Infrastructure Security**  
2. **Application Security**  
3. **Network Security**  
4. **Cloud Security**  
5. **Internet of Things (IoT) Security**

In addition to these five categories, **people** and **processes** also play an essential role in defending computer systems, networks, and the information within them.

## 🌍 Impact of Cybersecurity on the Digital World

These different categories reflect the extent that computer technologies have **transformed the world**.  

From online management of gas pipelines or electrical grids, to applications that allow people to **buy and sell goods online**, to **collaborating with colleagues across the globe**, to **renting cloud storage**, and even **tracking printer toner and maintenance** — all of these technologies have revolutionized how people live and do business.

The **digital transformation** has:
- Realized enormous efficiencies  
- Expanded unheard-of conveniences  
- Supplied omnipresent access to information  
- Exponentially increased productivity  

These advances have **grown wealth** and **improved quality of life**.

For example:
> People living in remote areas can access medical experts using computer technologies.  
> Personal medical information can be collected locally and securely transferred to specialists to assist in diagnosis and treatment.

However, without **securing computer networks** and the **links that connect them**, all of these advances are at risk.
