# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Overview

**Cybersecurity** is the practice of protecting computer networks, devices, and information from **damage, loss, or unauthorized access**.  
It plays a critical role in safeguarding **digital information** from cyberthreats.

---

## 🔐 Core Principles

The protection of information focuses on preserving the following:

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized users.  
- **Integrity** – Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data.  
- **Availability** – Guaranteeing reliable access to data and systems when needed.

## 🧑‍💻 Role of Cybersecurity Professionals

Cybersecurity professionals are responsible for securing:

- Servers  
- Endpoints  
- Databases  
- Networks  

They identify **security gaps** and **misconfigurations** that create vulnerabilities.

---

## 🧩 Categories of Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity can be divided into the following five categories:

1. **Critical Infrastructure Security**  
2. **Application Security**  
3. **Network Security**  
4. **Cloud Security**  
5. **Internet of Things (IoT) Security**

In addition to these five categories, **people** and **processes** also play an essential role in defending computer systems, networks, and the information within them.

## 🌍 Impact of Cybersecurity on the Digital World

These different categories reflect the extent that computer technologies have **transformed the world**.  

From online management of gas pipelines or electrical grids, to applications that allow people to **buy and sell goods online**, to **collaborating with colleagues across the globe**, to **renting cloud storage**, and even **tracking printer toner and maintenance** — all of these technologies have revolutionized how people live and do business.

The **digital transformation** has:
- Realized enormous efficiencies  
- Expanded unheard-of conveniences  
- Supplied omnipresent access to information  
- Exponentially increased productivity  

These advances have **grown wealth** and **improved quality of life**.

For example:
> People living in remote areas can access medical experts using computer technologies.  
> Personal medical information can be collected locally and securely transferred to specialists to assist in diagnosis and treatment.

However, without **securing computer networks** and the **links that connect them**, all of these advances are at risk.

## 🧠 Information Security (InfoSec)

**Information Security**, also known as **InfoSec**, is the practice of **protecting information** — both digital and physical.  

It involves the **tools**, **processes**, and **policies** used to:
- Prevent attacks and data breaches  
- Detect threats and vulnerabilities  
- Remediate and recover from security incidents  

InfoSec also includes **documenting processes, threats, and systems** that affect the security of information.

### 📂 Scope of Information

The scope of InfoSec is **broad and inclusive**, covering:
- Information stored **electronically** (e.g., on computers or databases)  
- Information stored **physically** (e.g., on paper, desks, or in file cabinets)  

Examples of information that may require protection:
- **Mission-critical data**  
- **HR policies**  
- **Legal contracts**

## 🏷️ Information Classification

Within an organization, IT security evaluates all information to **categorize and prioritize** its sensitivity.  

Common classification levels include:

| Classification | Description | Control Requirement |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Unprotected** | No controls necessary | None |
| **Protected** | Requires some level of control | Moderate |
| **Confidential** | Sensitive business or personal data | High |
| **Secret** | Restricted access; significant impact if exposed | Very High |
| **Top Secret** | National or organizational security level data | Maximum |

Each successive level demands **more rigorous controls and safeguards**.

---

## 🖥️ Information Systems Security

**Information Systems Security** is a **subset of InfoSec**.  
It refers to the protection of **information systems** against:
- Unauthorized access  
- Modification or destruction  
- Denial of access to authorized users  

Information systems include:
- Devices and hardware  
- Computer networks  
- Physical locations that store or transmit sensitive data  

The protected information can exist in **digital** or **physical** form.

## 🔁 Relationship Between Key Concepts

You can conclude the following hierarchy:

Information Security (InfoSec)
└── Information Systems Security
└── Cybersecurity

## 🧩 Importance of Cyber Awareness and Education

Given the importance of protecting **cyber infrastructure**, which is vital to the continued **prosperity** and **quality of life** for much of the world, certain **precautions** must be taken to ensure its safety and resilience.

It all begins with **people and education**.  
Numerous studies have identified **human error** as the **leading cause** of network and computer breaches.  

This challenge can be mitigated by:
- **Educating individuals** — both at work and at home — to think before they click.  
- **Raising awareness** about **phishing attacks** and other common tactics used by malicious actors.  
- **Promoting a culture of security**, where everyone understands their role in protecting data and systems.

> 🧠 **Remember:** Technology can only go so far — informed and vigilant users are the first line of defense in cybersecurity.

### 🗂️ Disaster Preparedness and Recovery

Another **first line of defense**, both at work and at home, is to **prepare for disaster** and **plan for recovery**.  

If you perform **regular backups** of your data and store them **safely offline**, then in the event that your data is:
- **Deleted or corrupted by malware**, or  
- **Encrypted by ransomware**,  

you can **restore your data** with minimal data loss and service interruption.

> 💾 **Tip:** Implement a *3-2-1 backup strategy* — keep **3 copies** of your data, on **2 different media types**, with **1 copy stored offline**.
