## 🦠 Malware Types

Has your computer ever acted strangely—slowing down, crashing, or showing unwanted pop-ups? Such behavior often indicates a **malware infection**, not “a ghost in the machine.” Malware can alter system behavior, damage data, and compromise security without visible warning.

### ⚠️ Common Symptoms of Malware Infection

- 💻 Devices suddenly become sluggish or unresponsive.  
- 🪟 Unwanted pop-up windows appear frequently.  
- 🚫 Applications crash, close, or fail to open.  
- 🧩 Files or programs open by themselves or show random errors.  
- 📩 Emails appear in your **Outbox** that you didn’t send.  
- 🌐 Browser homepage or settings change without your consent.  
- 💥 System crashes or shuts down unexpectedly.  

These signs suggest that malicious software—**malware, virus, or spyware**—may be present on your device.

### 🧬 Malware vs. Virus

While all **viruses are malware**, not all **malware are viruses**.

- **Malware** — Any software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system.  
- **Virus** — A specific type of malware that:
  1. Requires **user activation** to execute.
  2. **Attaches itself** to legitimate files or programs.
  3. **Spreads** infection to other applications or systems.

According to Norton, a virus *“alters the way a computer operates and spreads by attaching itself to legitimate software or documents.”*

### 🧫 Common Types of Computer Viruses

| Virus Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Resident Virus** | Infects applications as they are opened, remaining active in memory. |
| **Non-Resident Virus** | Infects executable files even when programs aren’t running. |
| **Multipartite Virus** | Spreads via multiple methods, infecting both memory and disk. |
| **Direct Action Virus** | Infects startup paths and deletes itself after execution; can destroy data. |
| **Browser Hijacker** | Alters browser settings and redirects searches; often bundled with adware. |
| **Overwrite Virus** | Destroys and replaces file content; recovery requires deleting infected files. |
| **Web Scripting Virus** | Injects malicious client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) into websites. |
| **File Infector Virus** | Infects .exe and .com files; one of the most common virus types. |
| **Network Virus** | Spreads across connected devices and networks, often crippling them. |
| **Boot Sector Virus** | Targets the master boot record (MBR), loading at system startup. |

### 🧩 Other Malware (Not Classified as Viruses)

| Malware Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Worm** | Self-replicating malware that spreads without user action or a host file. |
| **Rootkit** | Conceals itself or other malware deep within the OS kernel for persistent access. |
| **DLL Injection** | Replaces legitimate DLL files with malicious ones to execute hidden code. |
| **Driver Manipulation** | Alters hardware drivers to gain control or disrupt communication. |
| **Keylogger** | Records every keystroke to steal credentials or confidential data. |
| **PUP (Potentially Unwanted Program)** | Bundled software that includes spyware, adware, or dialers. |
| **Spyware** | Secretly gathers data about user activity and transmits it without consent. |
| **Adware** | Displays intrusive ads and may track online behavior for targeted marketing. |
| **Dialer** | Exploits modem/dialing features to make expensive unauthorized calls. |
| **Adversarial ML/AI** | Uses deceptive data to confuse machine learning or neural networks. |
| **Ransomware** | Encrypts or locks data; demands payment to restore access. |
| **Trojan Horse** | Disguises itself as legitimate software or files to deliver malware. |
| **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** | Enables remote control over the infected device. |
| **Dropper** | Installs or downloads additional malware payloads onto the target system. |
| **Rogue Security Software (Scareware)** | Fakes malware alerts to trick users into buying bogus “antivirus.” |
| **Botnet Malware** | Turns infected computers into remotely controlled bots for large-scale attacks. |
| **Cryptojacking** | Hijacks system resources to mine cryptocurrency without consent. |
